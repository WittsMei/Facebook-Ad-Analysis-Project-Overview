## North Star Metics and Dimensions



## Summary of Insights


- **Gender Targeting**: While the female audience segment generated higher impressions, clicks, and inquiries (Total Conversion), the male segment achieved nearly equal Approved Conversions (purchases). This suggests that males may have a higher conversion rate from inquiry to purchase.
- **Interest Targeting**: The interests with codes 101, 29, 16, 15, and 107 drove the highest Approved Conversions. Focusing more ad spend on these interest segments could yield a higher return on investment.
- **Age Targeting**: Despite allocating the highest ad spend to the 45-49 age group, the 30-34 age segment delivered almost twice as many Approved Conversions. Reallocating a larger portion of the budget towards the 30-34 age group could be more cost-effective.
- **Gender Conversion Rates**: The data indicates that male audiences from the campaign_c campaign tend to convert to actual purchases at a higher rate compared to females.

## Recommendations & Next Step
- Optimize gender targeting by maintaining strong exposure to both male and female audiences, but prioritize males for conversion campaigns or retargeting efforts.
- Increase ad spend allocation towards the top-performing interest segments (101, 29, 16, 15, 107) to drive more cost-efficient conversions.
- Gradually shift a larger portion of the age-based ad budget from the 45-49 segment to the 30-34 segment, which has proven to be more effective in driving purchases.
- Conduct further analysis on the customer journey and messaging resonance to understand why males exhibit higher purchase conversion rates and leverage those insights for campaign optimization.
- Implement ongoing campaign monitoring and optimization based on real-time performance data to continually refine audience targeting and messaging for maximum cost efficiency and return on ad spend.
